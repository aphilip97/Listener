# Listener

A GUI similar to that of [YouTube's chapters feature][1] for
navigating a single audio file that contain multiple songs in
the browser.

## Development

Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all the
dependencies.

### Environment variables

The project will put the compiled extension in a folder called
`output` at the root of the project by default.

This is the folder that you should load into the extension
after making your changes.

You can change the output directory by specifying an `OUTDIR`
variable in your environment.
